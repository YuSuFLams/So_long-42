* The map has to be a ``.ber`` file.
* It can only contain some of the following characters:

| 0 | Empty space. |
| C | Collectable. |
| E | Exit. |
| P | Player starting position. |

* The map must be a rectangle surrounded by walls ‘1’.
* It must have at least one collectable ‘C’. And only one player ‘P’ and exit ‘E’.
